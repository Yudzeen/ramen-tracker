# Ramen Tracker (alpha)

A ramen tracking app illustrating Android development using Java with MVVM architecture, Android Jetpack and other commonly used libraries.

Ramen Tracker is currently under heavy development. Note that some changes (such as database schema modifications) may not be backwards compatible during this alpha period and may cause the app to crash. In this case, please uninstall and re-install the app.
